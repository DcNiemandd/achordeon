## Foundations (from PRD §12 — decided)

- **Pure semantic AST.** String in, plain object out. No font, DOM, or canvas
  dependency; no geometry. Chords anchor to a **character index** into a line's
  text — the renderer turns that into a pixel x via `measureText`.
- **Single effective title / subtitle.** The model carries one `title` and one
  `subtitle` (not arrays). "Last wins"; shadowed ones become warnings.
- **Render options are not parsed from text** (ADR-0001) — they live in metadata.
- **Two-phase, line-oriented:**
  - **Phase 1 — line classification & blocking.** Split into lines, classify each,
    group into blocks.
  - **Phase 2 — inline scan ("the tokenizer").** Runs only over the content portion
    of content lines: chords `[…]`, escapes `\`, future markdown.

### AST shape (working sketch)

```
Song {
  title?:    string          // effective (last wins)
  subtitle?: string          // effective (last wins)
  blocks:    Block[]
  warnings:  Warning[]        // shadowed titles, invalid chords, … (TBD)
}
Block {
  label?:       string       // rendered label text (delimiter colon consumed)
  labelInline?: boolean       // true: label shared its source line with the first
                             // content line; false/absent: label stood alone and
                             // the body starts on the next line. Render-significant
                             // (see "Rendering notes").
  lines:        Line[]
}
Line {
  text:   string             // final rendered chars (brackets removed, escapes resolved)
  chords: ChordAnchor[]      // overlay by index; spans?: Span[] later (markdown)
}
ChordAnchor {
  raw:   string              // bracket content as written; rendered verbatim
  at:    number              // index into `text` (char the anchor sits above)
  valid: boolean             // true = transposable chord; false = verbatim annotation
}
```

## Phase 1 — line classification

Each line is classified as exactly one type. Precedence (first match wins):
**Blank → Subtitle → Title → Labelled content → Lyric.** _Chord-only_ is **not** a
line type — it is a property a content line acquires in Phase 2 once all its runs
are chords.

### Title / Subtitle (the asterisk rule) [decided]

- **Marker at column 0 _and_ followed by a space.** `* x` = Title, `** x` =
  Subtitle. `*bold*`, `***whoa***`, `*x` (no space) are **not** title/subtitle —
  they fall through to Lyric, where Phase-2 markdown owns `*`. The space
  requirement is what keeps `***` out of this branch with no special case.
- **Longest match: test `**`before`_`** so a subtitle never reads as a title
with a `_`-prefixed body.
- **Bodies are plain print text — no inline parsing.** The marker wins over the
  whole rest of the line: `* Song: Live [Acoustic]` is a Title literally reading
  `Song: Live [Acoustic]` — the colon is not a label, the brackets are not a
  chord, no escapes are processed.
- **Last wins → single effective value.** Multiple `*` lines: the last is the
  effective title; earlier ones emit a warning. Same for `**`.
- **Empty body** (`* ` then nothing/whitespace) → **treated as absent**: no value
  set, no warning (avoids silently clearing the title mid-keystroke).

### Labelled content (the colon-run rule) [decided]

A content line is **Labelled** iff, scanning from column 0, there is a **first
unescaped colon-run immediately followed by a space or end-of-line**. That run's
**last colon is the delimiter** (consumed); the run's earlier colons remain as
literal label text.

- **Label text** = everything before the run **+** (runLength − 1) literal colons.
  Label text is **plain** (no chord/inline parsing), like titles.
- **Content** = everything after the delimiter, with exactly **one** following
  space consumed; this remainder becomes the block's **first content line** and is
  inline-parsed normally (Phase 2).
- **A colon not followed by space-or-EOL is not a delimiter** → ordinary lyric.
  So `http://x`, `12:30` are plain lyrics and need no escaping; only a colon-run
  that ends in space/EOL is a label.
- **`\:` never counts** toward a delimiter.
- **Empty label text → not a label** (`: foo` is a plain lyric, leading `:`
  literal). An empty label is meaningless.

| Line               | Label      | First content-line text |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| `1.: First verse`  | `1.`       | `First verse`           |
| `R:: Block X`      | `R:`       | `Block X`               |
| `1:::`             | `1::`      | _(empty)_               |
| `2.: And [C]trade` | `2.`       | `And [C]trade`          |
| `Narrator: hi`     | `Narrator` | `hi`                    |
| `http://x`         | _(none)_   | lyric `http://x`        |
| `: foo`            | _(none)_   | lyric `: foo`           |

**Footgun:** `Narrator: hi` silently becomes a label. Accepted: the rule stays
uniform; `\:` is the escape and the editor surfaces a warning (error model — TBD).
No "looks like a label" heuristic (e.g. forbidding spaces in label text) — it would
kill legitimate multi-word labels like `Chorus 2:`.

### Block boundaries [decided]

1. **Blank line = boundary.** A line that is empty _or whitespace-only_ separates
   blocks. **Consecutive blanks collapse** to one boundary; leading/trailing blanks
   are ignored; **no empty blocks are emitted.** Blocks never contain interior
   blanks (a blank already closed the block).
2. **A labelled line always starts a new block** — even immediately after another
   labelled line with no blank between. Its post-delimiter content becomes the
   block's first content line **only if non-empty**.
3. **Consecutive unlabelled non-blank lines** stay in the **same** block.
4. **Title/Subtitle lines are boundaries** (decision ii): a `*`/`**` line is lifted
   to song-level _and_ separates blocks. It is neither blank nor content, so it
   never lives inside a block and never welds two blocks together.
5. **A block may have a label with zero content lines** (label-only, e.g. `Verse:`
   at EOF). Otherwise every block has ≥1 content line; no synthesized empty lines.

**Label position is preserved (`labelInline`).** `Verse: foo` (content on the label
line) and `Verse:` ⏎ `foo` (content on the next line) produce the _same_ label and
lines but differ in `labelInline` — the parser records which, because they render
differently (one rendered line vs two; see Rendering notes).

---

## Phase 2 — inline scan ("the tokenizer")

Runs only over the content portion of content lines (lyric lines and the content
of labelled lines). Title/Subtitle/label-text are plain and never reach here.

### Line model + chords [decided]

A line is held as **overlay-by-index** — a clean `text` string with chords floating
over it by character index — not interleaved runs. This _is_ the "chord above the
exact character" model; the renderer gets the x from `measureText(text.slice(0, at))`.

1. **Anchor = the character immediately _after_ the closing bracket**
   (chord-over-next-char). `tr[C]ade` → `text:"trade"`, `C` at `2`. A bracket at
   end-of-line anchors at `text.length` (renderer places it at the end).
2. **Every unescaped `[…]` is an above-line anchor.** Literal inline brackets in a
   lyric require the `\[` escape.
3. **Multiple chords in one bracket** split on spaces/commas → multiple anchors **at
   the same index**, in order; each validated independently. A line whose `text` is
   empty/whitespace but carries chords is a **chord-only line** (a render property,
   not a parse type).
4. **Invalid bracket = annotation, not literal text** (decision Q). `[Solo]`,
   `[x2]`, `[N.C.]` still become anchors (`parsed: null`), rendered **verbatim** and
   never transposed — they float above like a chord, matching real chord-sheet
   convention. Validity only decides transposable-vs-verbatim; truly literal
   brackets are the `\[` case.

### Chord validity & transpose [decided]

- The **only** reason to parse a chord is transpose, so the AST keeps **no parsed
  chord object** — just `valid: boolean` per anchor. Transpose is a **source-text**
  operation (it rewrites the original content string, per CONTEXT), owned by
  `TransposeService`, not a transform on this AST.
- **Validity + transpose use `@tonaljs/chord`** (pure logic, no DOM, tree-shakeable,
  offline-fine). `Chord.get(raw).empty === true` ⇒ invalid ⇒ `valid:false` ⇒
  verbatim annotation, never transposed (decision Q). Dependency policy: **minimal
  deps, justified case-by-case** (PRD §2) — chord theory is a solved, fiddly domain
  worth not hand-rolling.
- **Spelling on transpose:** no uniquely "correct" spelling exists without a key —
  it follows from the _interval_, not the semitone count (3 semitones up = minor
  third `C→E♭` or augmented second `C→D♯`, by key). With no declared key,
  **direction-based** (up→♯, down→♭) is a standard simple heuristic; **key-aware**
  is the truly correct refinement and is already future (CONTEXT). Even tonal needs
  the interval picked (`m2` vs `A1` are both one semitone), which direction supplies.
  Full detail belongs to the transpose grilling, not here.

### No nesting [decided]

Chords and markdown never nest: no chord inside a chord, no `[` inside `[…]`, and
(future) no same-type markdown inside itself (bold-in-bold). Inside `[…]`, everything
up to the first unescaped `]` is chord content. The editor's insert buttons enforce
this by disabling the action when it would nest — the enforcement itself is a future
upgrade (see Authoring notes).

### Escapes [decided]

- **Escape set (resolved):** `\` immediately followed by `:` `*` `[` `]` `\` → the
  backslash is **consumed** and the char is literal. `\\` → one literal `\`. `]` is
  escapable for symmetry with `[`, so a literal bracketed word reads `\[word\]`
  without stranding the trailing backslash.
- **`\` before anything else is a literal backslash** (kept): `C:\path` keeps `\p`,
  `\n` is backslash-then-n, a trailing `\` at EOL is literal. No backslash-eating.
- **Resolved inside bracket tokens too, not only lyric text.** A repeat sign
  `[||\: … :||]` must escape its colon — an unescaped `[||:` is a colon-run
  followed by a space, so Phase 1 reads `[||` as a **label**. The escape is
  load-bearing, and its backslash is consumed when the token is rendered
  (`||\:` → `||:`), never left in the output.
- **Phase split:**
  - **Phase 1 is escape-_aware_ but does not consume.** An escaped `:` is not a
    label delimiter (`Narrator\:` → lyric); an escaped leading `*` is not a title.
    Classification only; the raw characters pass to Phase 2.
  - **Resolution happens in Phase 2, only on lyric/content text** — where `[`/`*`
    are actually special.
- **Title and label text are fully literal — no escape resolution.** Their only
  special char is positional (the `*` marker, the colon delimiter); they carry no
  inline markup, so a backslash inside them just renders (keeps Q3 consistent).
- **Cross-phase courtesy:** `\:` is resolved in Phase 2 even though `:` is not
  special there — the user typed it to defeat the _Phase-1_ label rule, so the stray
  backslash must not survive into the rendered lyric. `Narrator\: hi` → Phase 1
  "lyric" → Phase 2 renders `Narrator: hi`.

---

## Error / warning model [decided]

- **The parser is total — it never throws.** Any input (including half-typed text)
  yields a `Song` AST; problems surface as structured warnings. A parser feeding a
  live editor cannot throw.
- **`Warning { code: WarningCode; line: number; range?: [start, end]; data?: {…} }`**
  — code + source location + data, **never a baked string**. The UI localizes via
  `@angular/localize` (PRD §11). Adapts directly to editor diagnostics (Monaco
  `setModelMarkers`/`IMarkerData`, CodeMirror lint).
- **v1 codes:** `SHADOWED_TITLE`, `SHADOWED_SUBTITLE` (the "warning under all but the
  effective Title/Subtitle"). The enum stays open.
- **Deliberately not warnings:** invalid chords (`[N.C.]`, `[x2]` render verbatim by
  design — decision Q) and the label footgun (`Narrator: hi`; intent is unknowable,
  `\:` is the remedy, and false positives on `Chorus 2:` would be worse).

---

## Reparse [decided]

**Full reparse, debounced.** On editor change → debounce → `parse(getValue())` →
one fresh AST feeding **both** the render-preview signal and the editor markers. A
Song is "one page" (tens–low-hundreds of lines), so a full parse is sub-millisecond;
incremental dirty-tracking is premature optimization and would add stateful
complexity to a deliberately pure module.

- The **parse→render/markers debounce** (~50–150 ms, smooth preview) is **separate**
  from §5's keystroke-debounced autosave-to-IndexedDB — different cadence, different
  purpose ("show me" vs "don't lose my work").
- The editor's own highlighter (Monarch / CM) runs on its own schedule, independent
  of this parse.

---

## Authoring notes (deferred → editor PRD)

Editor insert buttons write markup at the cursor; they constrain the grammar (hence
noted) but are an editor concern:

- **Chord** / **Markdown (bold, italic)** — inserted at the exact cursor location,
  following chord/markdown rules. **Disabled when it would nest** (inside a chord, or
  same-type markdown inside itself). The disable guard is a **future upgrade**.
- **Label** — inserts the block's label marker and moves the cursor in front of it.
- **Title / Subtitle** — mark the current row (`*` / `**`), no rules.

### Editor integration — choice **[decided → CodeMirror 6, ADR-0010]**

The editor is **CodeMirror 6**, in the `songs` scope, behind a loose-coupling seam
(ADR-0010). Constraint that drove it: the product wants **syntax highlighting +
inline warning underlines**, so a plain `<textarea>` is insufficient — the editor
must be a highlighting code editor. Monaco was the other candidate; it lost once its
only edge (author familiarity) proved false, leaving CodeMirror 6 ahead on offline-
PWA bundle weight, Angular-21 integration (no worker plumbing), and touch-readiness.

The choice changes **nothing** decided in this spec: `ParserService` is a pure
`string → AST` function, **editor-agnostic**, and the editor consumes it through the
same four hooks either editor would expose — so the spec stayed editor-neutral and
the pick is swappable by design:

| Need               | Monaco                               | CodeMirror 6         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| highlight grammar  | Monarch (`setMonarchTokensProvider`) | stream/Lezer parser  |
| warning underlines | `setModelMarkers` / `IMarkerData`    | lint diagnostics     |
| reparse trigger    | `onDidChangeModelContent`            | update listener      |
| insert buttons     | `executeEdits` + cursor              | dispatch transaction |

Either way there are **two tokenizers**, both bound to this spec:

- the editor's **highlight grammar** — _colouring only_, line-oriented, **local**;
  it cannot do cross-document semantics (e.g. "shadowed title"). Our two-phase
  line-oriented grammar maps onto it directly.
- **`ParserService`** — the _semantic_ parser: render AST + warnings; cross-document
  diagnostics live here.

Why CodeMirror 6 won (recorded in ADR-0010): Monaco is heavy (MB-scale, workers) for
an offline PWA and documented-unsupported on touch; its only advantage was author
familiarity, which proved false. CodeMirror 6 is the lighter, worker-free, touch-
ready fit, and integrates into Angular 21 without worker plumbing. Highlighting uses
a CodeMirror **stream parser** (not a Lezer grammar) — the lightweight path the line-
oriented grammar maps onto directly.

## Rendering notes (deferred → rendering PRD)

Captured here so they aren't lost; they belong to the _rendering_ layer, not the
parser. The parser only preserves the information; the renderer acts on it.

- **`labelInline`** — a label with same-source-line content renders **together on
  one line** (label then content). A label whose content starts on the **next**
  source line renders on **two lines** (label, then content below). This is special,
  intentional behaviour, driven by the `labelInline` flag on the block.
- **Chord-only line / block** — a line whose `text` is empty/whitespace but carries
  chords renders its chords **distributed across the width**; a block whose lines are
  all chord-only renders **slightly larger** (the bridge convention, CONTEXT). Both
  are render properties read off the AST, not parse types.
